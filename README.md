# Merkle Tree Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Merkle Tree, a fundamental data structure in cryptography and blockchain technology. Merkle Trees are binary trees where each leaf node is the hash of a data block, and each non-leaf node is the hash of its children. The root of the tree offers a cryptographic summary of all the data contained within the tree.

## Features

- **Simplicity**: Straightforward and understandable Python code for Merkle Tree operations.
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Utilizes the SHA-256 hash function for generating node hashes, providing cryptographic security.
- **Proof Generation**: Capability to generate proofs of data inclusion without revealing the entire tree.
- **Proof Verification**: Functionality to verify the proofs, ensuring data integrity and membership with only the Merkle root.

## Usage

### Setting Up
